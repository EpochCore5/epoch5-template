## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EpochCore5/epoch5-template.git
   cd epoch5-template
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

## StrategyDECK AI Agent

### Purpose
- Automates strategic tasks and processes within the project.
- Enhances efficiency and intelligent decision-making.
- Serves as a foundation for further agent-based extensions.

### Setup
1. Ensure dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Import and initialize the agent in your code:
   ```python
   from strategydeck_agent import StrategyDeckAgent

   agent = StrategyDeckAgent()
   def sample_task():
       # Your strategic logic here
       return "Task completed!"

   result = agent.execute_task(sample_task)
   print(result)
   ```

### Extensibility & Multi-Agent Support
- The agent is designed for easy extension. Add new methods or agent classes as needed.
- For multiple agents, instantiate additional `StrategyDeckAgent` objects or implement a manager class.

### Error Handling & Logging
- All agent actions are logged using Python's `logging` module.
- Errors are captured and reported for robust operation.

### Contributing
- See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines on extending agent functionality.

### Development Setup

For development setup instructions, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Overview

The EPOCH5 Template provides a complete ecosystem for:

- **Advanced Logging & Provenance**: Hash-chained ledger system with tamper-evident records
- **Agent Management**: Decentralized identifiers (DIDs), registry, and real-time monitoring
- **Policy & Security**: Rule enforcement with quorum requirements and multi-signature approvals
- **DAG Management**: Directed Acyclic Graph execution with fault-tolerant mechanisms
- **Cycle Execution**: Budget control, latency tracking, and PBFT consensus
- **Data Integrity**: Capsule storage with Merkle tree proofs and ZIP archiving
- **Meta-Capsules**: Comprehensive system state capture and ledger integration

## Architecture Components

### Core Modules

| Module | Description | Key Features |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `integration.py` | Main system orchestrator | Workflow management, system status, validation |
| `agent_management.py` | Agent lifecycle management | DID generation, registry, heartbeat monitoring |
| `policy_grants.py` | Security enforcement | Policy creation, grant management, rule evaluation |
| `capsule_metadata.py` | Data integrity system | Merkle trees, ZIP archiving, integrity verification |
| `cycle_execution.py` | Task execution engine | PBFT consensus, SLA tracking, budget control |
| `ceiling_manager.py` | Resource optimization | Dynamic limits, tier management, performance scoring |

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# System management
python integration.py setup-demo       # Initialize demo environment
python integration.py status          # Show system status
python integration.py validate        # Validate system integrity
python integration.py run-workflow    # Execute complete workflow

# Agent operations
python integration.py agents list     # List all agents
python integration.py agents create skill1 skill2  # Create new agent

# Policy management
python integration.py policies list   # List active policies

# Quick operations
python integration.py oneliner quick-agent     # Quick agent creation
python integration.py oneliner system-snapshot  # System state capture
```

### Web Dashboard
