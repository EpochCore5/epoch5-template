# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Status
- Current test coverage: **35.37%** (730 lines covered out of 2064 valid lines)
- Target coverage: **>80%**

## Files Requiring Most Coverage Improvement

Based on the coverage report, these files need the most work:

| File | Current Coverage | Priority |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| ceiling_dashboard.py | 0% | High |
| meta_capsule.py | 15.28% | High |
| cycle_execution.py | 26.15% | High |
| dag_management.py | 31.25% | Medium |
| integration.py | 40.47% | Medium |
| ceiling_manager.py | 36.21% | Medium |
| policy_grants.py | 48.69% | Medium |
| capsule_metadata.py | 58.45% | Low |
| agent_management.py | 58.18% | Low |

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Prioritize Core Functionality First**
   - Focus on testing core business logic in files with lowest coverage
   - Ensure all public methods have at least one test case

2. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Create end-to-end tests for key workflows
   - Test interactions between components

3. **Test Edge Cases and Error Handling**
   - Add tests for failure scenarios
   - Test input validation and error responses

## New Test Files to Create

1. `tests/test_ceiling_dashboard.py`
2. `tests/test_meta_capsule.py`
3. `tests/test_cycle_execution.py`
4. `tests/test_dag_management.py`
5. `tests/test_ceiling_manager.py`

## For Existing Test Files

Expand existing test files with more test cases covering:
- Edge cases
- Error conditions
- Additional method tests

## Implementation Plan

1. Create test utilities and fixtures to simplify test setup
2. Develop mock objects for external dependencies
3. Write tests in order of priority
4. Regularly run coverage reports to track progress
5. Focus on uncovered branches and untested methods

## Timeline

- Day 1: Set up test infrastructure, mock objects, and fixtures
- Day 2-3: Implement high priority tests
- Day 4-5: Implement medium priority tests
- Day 6: Implement low priority tests
- Day 7: Final coverage optimization and documentation
