## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the EPOCH5 Template seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to jryan2k19@gmail.com with the following information:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

You should expect a response within 48 hours of your report. We'll keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement.

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not access a system or account beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability
- Report vulnerabilities as soon as possible after discovery
- Do not run automated vulnerability scanners without explicit permission

## Security Update Process

When we learn of a security vulnerability, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported releases
4. Release patched versions as quickly as possible
5. Announce the vulnerability in our security advisory

## Security Features

The EPOCH5 Template includes several security features:

- Hash-chained ledger system with tamper-evident records
- Cryptographic integrity checks using SHA-256
- Decentralized identifier (DID) system for agent authentication
- Policy-based access control with quorum requirements
- Multi-signature approval mechanisms
- Secure file archiving with integrity verification

## Security Best Practices

When using the EPOCH5 Template:

- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Use strong, unique identifiers for agents and capsules
- Regularly audit access logs and heartbeat records
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures
- Monitor system metrics for anomalous behavior
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Enable all security scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline
