# EPOCH5 Template - Getting Started Guide

## Hello! Need Help? You're in the right place! 👋

Welcome to the EPOCH5 Template system! This guide will help you get started quickly and understand what this powerful system can do for you.

## What is EPOCH5?

EPOCH5 is a comprehensive system for managing:
- **Agents** with decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and performance tracking
- **Security policies** with multi-signature and quorum requirements  
- **Data integrity** with tamper-evident storage and Merkle tree verification
- **Resource management** with dynamic ceiling adjustments
- **Workflow automation** with DAG execution and consensus mechanisms

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Set up the demo environment
```bash
python integration.py setup-demo
```

### 2. Check system status
```bash
python integration.py status
```

### 3. Launch the web dashboard
```bash
bash ceiling_launcher.sh
# Select option 1 to launch dashboard
# Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```

### 4. Run a complete workflow demonstration
```bash
python integration.py run-workflow
```

## Common Tasks

### Agent Management
```bash
# List all agents
python integration.py agents list

# Create a new agent with skills
python integration.py agents create python data_processing ml

# View agent performance
python integration.py agents list
```

### Policy Management
```bash
# List active policies
python integration.py policies list

# View policy details
python integration.py policies list
```

### Resource Ceiling Management
```bash
# List ceiling configurations
python integration.py ceilings list

# Create new ceiling config
python integration.py ceilings create my_config --tier professional

# View pricing tiers
python integration.py ceilings tiers
```

### System Operations
```bash
# Validate system integrity
python integration.py validate

# Get detailed system status
python integration.py status

# Run one-liner commands
python integration.py oneliner system-snapshot
python integration.py oneliner quick-agent
```

## Web Dashboard Features

The web dashboard (launched via `bash ceiling_launcher.sh`) provides:

1. **Real-time monitoring** of system metrics
2. **Service tier management** with pricing information
3. **Performance tracking** with dynamic adjustments
4. **Configuration management** for ceiling settings
5. **Upgrade recommendations** based on usage patterns

## Testing & Development

### Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests (now 100% passing!)
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test category
pytest tests/test_agent_management.py
```

### Development Tools
```bash
# Format code
make format

# Run linting
make lint

# Security scan
make security

# Run all quality checks
make all-checks
```

## System Architecture

The system consists of these key components:

- **Agent Management** (`agent_management.py`) - DID generation, registry, monitoring
- **Policy Enforcement** (`policy_grants.py`) - Security rules, grants, compliance  
- **Data Integrity** (`capsule_metadata.py`) - Merkle trees, archives, verification
- **Resource Management** (`ceiling_manager.py`) - Dynamic limits, performance optimization
- **Workflow Execution** (`cycle_execution.py`, `dag_management.py`) - Task automation
- **Integration Hub** (`integration.py`) - System orchestration and CLI
