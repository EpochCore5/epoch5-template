## Coverage Improvement Guidelines

### 1. General Strategy
- Focus on one module at a time, starting with the lowest coverage modules
- Implement comprehensive test files with proper fixtures and mocking
- Ensure edge cases and error scenarios are covered
- Test all public methods and critical code paths

### 2. Testing Approach
- Use pytest fixtures for common test setup
- Leverage mock objects to isolate components
- Implement both unit tests and integration tests
- Follow test naming conventions: `test_{method_name}_{scenario}`
- Use parameterized tests for multiple similar scenarios

### 3. Mocking Strategy
- Create mock objects for external dependencies
- Use temporary directories for file operations
- Mock HTTP requests and responses
- Mock database connections and queries

### 4. Error & Edge Case Testing
- Test with invalid inputs
- Test boundary conditions
- Test error handling and exceptions
- Test race conditions where applicable

### 5. Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- Test end-to-end workflows
- Test API contracts

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Create GitHub Actions workflow for test coverage reporting
- [x] Generate coverage badge for README
- [x] Set up coverage analysis tools
- [x] Create test_ceiling_dashboard.py
- [ ] Create test_meta_capsule.py
- [ ] Create test_cycle_execution.py
- [ ] Create test_dag_management.py
- [ ] Create test_ceiling_manager.py
- [ ] Enhance test_integration.py
- [ ] Enhance test_policy_grants.py
- [ ] Enhance test_capsule_metadata.py
- [ ] Enhance test_agent_management.py
- [ ] Run final coverage check
- [ ] Update README with final coverage badge

## Tracking Progress

Each test implementation will be committed separately with a descriptive message indicating:
1. The module being tested
2. The initial coverage of the module
3. The new coverage after tests
4. The overall project coverage

For example:
```
Add tests for ceiling_dashboard.py

- Initial module coverage: 0%
- New module coverage: 92%
- Overall project coverage: 42.1% (+6.73%)
```
