# EPOCH5 CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement

This document describes the production-grade CI/CD pipeline enhancements implemented for the EPOCH5 Template project.

## Overview

The enhanced CI/CD pipeline includes:

1. **Deployment Automation Tools**: Docker containerization, automated deployments, rollback mechanisms
2. **Cloud Platform Integration**: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, multi-cloud support
3. **Monitoring and Observability**: Prometheus/Grafana, ELK stack, comprehensive alerting

## Features Implemented

### üê≥ Containerization

- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build with security best practices
- **Docker Compose**: Full stack deployment with monitoring services
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health endpoints for container orchestration
- **.dockerignore**: Optimized build contexts

### üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

Enhanced GitHub Actions workflow with:

- **Multi-platform builds**: Linux/AMD64 and ARM64 support
- **Container registry**: Automated pushes to GitHub Container Registry
- **Blue/Green deployments**: Zero-downtime deployment strategy
- **Canary deployments**: Gradual rollout with automated monitoring
- **Rollback mechanisms**: Automated and manual rollback capabilities

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Infrastructure

**Terraform configurations for:**
- **AWS**: ECS Fargate, Application Load Balancer, VPC, Security Groups
- **Azure**: Container Instances, Traffic Manager, Virtual Networks
- **Multi-cloud**: Portable configurations for different cloud providers

### üìä Monitoring Stack

**Prometheus + Grafana:**
- Custom dashboards for EPOCH5 metrics
- Real-time performance monitoring
- SLA tracking and alerting

**ELK Stack:**
- Centralized log collection and analysis
- Custom log parsing for EPOCH5 components
- Elasticsearch storage with Kibana visualization

### üîî Alerting

**Multi-channel alerting:**
- **Email**: SMTP integration for team notifications
- **Slack**: Webhook integration for chat alerts
- **PagerDuty**: Critical incident escalation
- **Tiered alerts**: Critical, warning, and informational levels

## Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# Start development environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Full monitoring stack
docker-compose up -d

# Access services
# App: http://localhost:8080
# Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/epoch5admin)
# Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
# Kibana: http://localhost:5601
```

### Deployment Scripts

```bash
# Blue/green deployment
./scripts/deploy-blue-green.sh blue latest

# Canary deployment with 10% traffic
./scripts/deploy-canary.sh latest ghcr.io/epochcore5/epoch5-template 10

# Emergency rollback
./scripts/rollback.sh production
```

### Infrastructure Deployment

```bash
# AWS deployment
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="aws.tfvars"
terraform apply

# Azure deployment
terraform plan -var-file="azure.tfvars"
terraform apply
```

## Health Endpoints

The application provides several endpoints for monitoring:

- `GET /health` - Basic health check (200 OK if healthy)
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus-compatible metrics
- `GET /status` - Detailed system status (JSON)

## Monitoring Metrics

Key metrics exposed:

- `epoch5_agents_total` - Total number of agents
- `epoch5_agents_active` - Currently active agents
- `epoch5_policies_total` - Total policies configured
- `epoch5_capsules_total` - Total capsules created
- `epoch5_up` - Service availability (1 = up, 0 = down)

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue/Green Deployment

1. Deploy new version to inactive environment (blue/green)
2. Run health checks and integration tests
3. Switch traffic to new environment
4. Keep old environment for quick rollback

### Canary Deployment

1. Deploy new version to canary environment
2. Route small percentage of traffic (10%) to canary
3. Monitor error rates and performance metrics
4. Gradually increase traffic or rollback if issues detected
5. Promote to full deployment when stable

### Rollback Process

1. Identify last known good version
2. Update container orchestration to use previous image
3. Verify health checks pass
4. Notify team of rollback completion

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `ENVIRONMENT` - Deployment environment (development/staging/production)
- `PYTHONPATH` - Python module path
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging verbosity

### Secrets Management

- GitHub Container Registry credentials via `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- Cloud provider credentials via service accounts
- Alerting webhook URLs and API keys via secrets

### Monitoring Configuration

- **Prometheus**: `monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml`
- **Grafana**: `monitoring/grafana/dashboards/`
- **Logstash**: `monitoring/logstash/logstash.conf`
- **Alertmanager**: `monitoring/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml`

## Security Considerations

- Non-root container user
- Security scanning with Bandit and Safety
- Dependency vulnerability checking
- Secret management best practices
- Network security with proper security groups

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Container health check failures**: Check application logs and /health endpoint
2. **Build failures**: Verify requirements.txt and Dockerfile
3. **Deployment timeouts**: Increase timeout values in scripts
4. **Monitoring gaps**: Verify service discovery configuration

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check container logs
docker-compose logs epoch5-app

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Check metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods,svc,ingress -l app=epoch5
```
